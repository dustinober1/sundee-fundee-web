# Sundee Fundee Web

Public marketing, blog, donations, and printable workout-plan downloads for
`sundeefundee.com`.

The native iOS app is the live app product. The website exists for marketing,
SEO content, donation checkout, roadmap/legal pages, and PDF workout plans.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Local dev runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

Stripe checkout requires `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` in your environment. Stripe webhook
persistence can optionally use Supabase with `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and
server-only `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`. Start from `.env.example` for local
setup.

Google Search Console verification can be added with
`NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION`; the root layout will emit the matching
verification meta tag when the value is present.

## SEO operations

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION` when this environment should emit the
Search Console verification meta tag. Follow the monthly workflow in
`docs/seo/search-console-workflow.md` for Search Console exports and page
refresh work. That workflow treats CTR in direct Google Search Console export
percentage form, such as `0.39` for `0.39%`, unless you explicitly normalize it
before scoring. Validate SEO changes with `npm run test:metadata` and
`npm run test:seo` before deploy.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # local development
npm run lint       # eslint (may include pre-existing Next.js <img> warnings)
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
npm run build      # Next production build
npm run test:seo   # sitemap, schema, robots, and SEO route checks
npm run preview    # OpenNext Cloudflare preview
npm run deploy     # OpenNext Cloudflare deploy
```

## Content

Blog posts live in `src/app/blog/content/*.json`.

App Store links and shared site metadata live in `src/lib/site.ts`.

## Deployment

Production runs on **Vercel** (verified via response headers, October 2026):
merges to `main` deploy automatically through the Vercel GitHub integration,
and PRs get preview deployments. Analytics use Vercel Web Analytics
(`@vercel/analytics`).

The repo also carries a partial OpenNext/Cloudflare setup (`wrangler.jsonc`,
`npm run preview` / `npm run deploy`) for a potential future migration. It is
not the production host. Local preview limits (use Node 22 per `.nvmrc`):

- Static pages and all Open Graph image routes serve correctly.
- Pages that need blog content re-render from source on a cache miss
  (home, blog index), which cannot work in Cloudflare Workers because article
  JSON is read from disk at runtime. Prerendered-but-cached routes (RSS,
  sitemap) fail in local preview only because no incremental-cache binding
  (R2/KV) is configured. Completing the Cloudflare path would require
  build-time content inlining plus cache bindings — see
  `docs/CODEBASE.md` §13.
